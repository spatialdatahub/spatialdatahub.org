  Spatial Data Hub is a web application built for scientific researchers to explore, advertise, and share spatial research data without storing it in a specific database. Most research data tools are focused on data accessibility, as defined by the FAIR data principles (https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples). Spatial Data Hub is a data findability tool with the goal of becomming a top Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data displaying website. Work on Spatial Data Hub began in May 2016 and has continued since. However, lately the focus has shifted to preparing a scientific manuscript describing Spatial Data Hub for peer review and publication. The project is based out of the <a href="https://www.leibniz-zmt.de/en/" target="_blank">Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research</a> in Bremen, Germany. We plan to keep the code behind the website as simple as possible, while staying up to date with the latest trends. Further functionality will be added as the project matures.
